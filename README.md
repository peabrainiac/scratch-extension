# Scratch Extension
A Browser Addon that adds various functionalities to [the Scratch Website](https://scratch.mit.edu).

Current features:
 - a quick & simple message viewer
 - a dark theme that can be toggled on and of (works on the website, but doesn't work on the project editor yet)
 - some tools to make it easier to manage large studios
 
 I'm not really actively developing this anymore, but I thought I'd put it up here in case anyone else want to help - also, if there are any severe or urgent bugs you can report them here by [opening an issue](https://github.com/peabrainiac/scratch-extension/issues) and I'll see what I can do to fix it.
 
 # Install
 
 The latest release is available for Firefox on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scratch-extension/).
 
 To run a copy of the latest version locally, go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click on "load temporary addon" and select one of the files in the source folder. The addon will then be installed until you close your browser (or remove it manually using the same page).
 
# Compatibility

This is a WebExtension, so it should work in most modern browsers - I've only tested it in firefox though. Feel free to upload this to other browser addon marketplaces, such as the chrome web store, but please link back to the this or a forked github repository if you do so. If there are any compatibility issues that you know how to fix, feel free to open a pull request and I'll see if I can add it to the repository.
